    "strategy": "A Great Artist can create a Great Work of Art (generates both Culture and Tourism) that is placed in the nearest city that has an appropriate building with an empty slot (like the Palace, a Museum, or a Cathedral). A Great Artist can also create a Golden Age. Great Artists are expended when used either of these ways.",
    "historical_info": "\"Great Artists\" are the visionaries of civilization. They interpret the world, bringing beauty, brilliance, form and color where none may have been found before. They carve the statues, paint the pictures, take the photos and make the films that define our humanity. Often their work surpasses its time and place, enlighten and elevate a people, making a civilization far greater than its material possessions and power.",
