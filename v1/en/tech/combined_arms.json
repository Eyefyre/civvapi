    "civilopedia_entry": "Combined arms is a military doctrine first adopted more than a thousand years ago, which involves the combination of different-but complimentary-unit types in an effort to improve the overall efficiency of the force as a whole. In ancient times, the combined arms tactic was utilized by many of the major powers, particularly the Greeks and Romans, who carefully coordinated light and heavy infantry, cavalry, and ranged weapons to create cohesive formations that played off each others' strengths and weaknesses. In the present day, the rise of aircraft-based weaponry has led to even more complex variations on the traditional concept of combined arms. Drone aircraft, satellite-guided missiles, and high-altitude bombers are just a few examples of the expanding toolset available to modern military commanders.",
