A wat consists of a temple containing statues of the Buddha, a prayer room, a room containing religious texts, a pavilion for relaxation, a library, study hall, bell towers, and living quarters. It may be a single building or a collection of structures - a town in itself. Constructed in the 12th century, the Angkor Wat in Angkor, Cambodia, is one of the largest and best-preserved wats in Southeast Asia.",
