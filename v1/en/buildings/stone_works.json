The art of stonemasonry is one of the world's oldest professions, encompassing everything from the extraction of stone from quarries, to the actual carving of geometric shapes and the fitment of these stones at the building site. Historically, stonemasons have worked with everything from Limestone, which was primarily used in building massive structures, to Granite and Marble which were more commonly found in statues and monuments.",
