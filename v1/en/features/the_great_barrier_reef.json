Constructed over 500,000 years by billions of coral polyps, the Great Barrier Reef is the largest single structure made by living creatures. The Great Barrier Reef is home to a hugely diverse population of whales, dolphins, porpoises, dugongs, turtles, fish, octopi, and snakes, not to mention over 200 species of birds.",
