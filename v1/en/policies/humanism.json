    "historical_info": "Humanism is the philosophy that says that the human being is the most important thing in the world. There are no \"higher beings\" or supernatural powers that humans owe allegiance to or who give us guidance or wisdom. There's just us. Humanism has been around in one form or another since ancient Greece, and it also appears in Asian and Indian writings some two to three thousand years ago. It made a strong reappearance in the Renaissance, and remains a powerful philosophical force today.",

        "historical_info": "Rationalism is a worldview that looks to reason (rather than, say, faith) to explain the world. Rationalism believes that reason trumps all other ways of interpreting the world, including any data gathered by one's five senses. This philosophy can be traced back to the great Socrates of ancient Greece, and it enjoyed something of a resurgence during the 16th and 17th century in Europe, when it was explored by men like Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant."
