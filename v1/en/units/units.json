While they may carry torpedoes and surface-to-air missiles for their own defense, their primary duty is to stay hidden and avoid direct conflict with the enemy. They must survive at all costs.Nuclear submarines formed a part of the US' and USSR's \"Mutual Assured Destruction\" doctrine: if either side were to hit the other with a sneak nuclear attack, no matter how successful the attack, if even one enemy sub survived it could rain down a horrifying amount of death upon the victor, destroying them as well. Thus, the doctrine states, unless one can be TOTALLY assured that they can absolutely and without question destroy every one of the enemy's nuclear subs, planes and ICBMs, nuclear war is unwinnable.

In December of 1941 the Japanese navy proved the power of aircraft carriers beyond the shadow of a doubt by destroying much of the American Pacific fleet (including most of its vaunted battleships) in a brilliant surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. By an extraordinary stroke of fortune the American carriers were not at port when the attack occurred, and these were able to slow the Japanese advance until the massive US carrier production effort began to bear fruit, eventually resulting in overwhelming American carrier (and air) superiority, and crushing defeat for Japan.",

The sub's job was to sink merchant craft and then slip away before the enemy warships or aircraft could find them. In encounters with destroyers the sub generally got the worst of the engagement. In both World Wars I and II German \"U-boats\" came perilously close to starving the United Kingdom into submission, sinking 11 million tons of shipping in World War I and 14 million tons in World War II, at a cost of close to 1,000 u-boats sunk.",

The vehicle is equipped with sophisticated computers, radar, and communications equipment far exceeding anything available anywhere before in history.

As the war progressed and the Allies designed fighters capable of escorting the bombers into enemy territory, the B-17's raids became more successful, doing crippling damage to German industry and cities.Over 12,000 B-17s were constructed during World War II and approximately a third of them were lost in combat.",

Some fighter aircraft also carry bombs to be used against ground units, but even those without bombs can still strafe enemy ground or naval units with deadly effect.Modern jet fighters are faster, better-armed and armored than those from World War II, but the principles of air combat remain, and the force with air superiority has a tremendous advantage over its enemy.",

German paratroopers assaulted and captured the island of Crete from the air in 1941, however, the troopers' casualties were so horrific that Adolf Hitler forbid future large-scale airborne assaults. The Allied forces deployed paratroopers with moderate success during the Normandy invasion in 1944, but the huge Market Garden paradrops in the Netherlands and Germany later that same year were far from successful, resulting in heavy casualties to the British, Polish and American paratroopers.While special forces troops still employ paratroopers, the practice has fallen out of favor in modern armies.

Although poorly designed and plagued by engine problems and inexperienced crewmen, the early tanks did show great potential - at least to those paying attention. In World War II, the Germans employed the \"blitzkrieg\" - lightning-fast assaults headed by fleets of tanks - to extraordinary effect, conquering France and driving the British army right off the continent before their generals could figure out a response to the astonishing new tactic.

His only protective armor was a metal helmet which was mostly ineffective against direct gunfire, providing at best limited protection against shrapnel. The men on all sides were tough and resourceful and they died in the hundreds of thousands fighting for their homes and countries.",

By the end of the Civil War the rifled musket was rendered obsolete by the breech-loading repeating rifle, which had a firing rate of perhaps a second (as fast as one could cock the lever and pull the trigger), compared to the muzzle-loading rifle's firing rate of perhaps 20 to 30 seconds per shot for a well-trained soldier.",

It's likely that the Mongols introduced cannon to the Islamic world, and the Europeans learned of it from the Muslims. The earliest cannon were huge, unwieldy, dangerous affairs that often exploded when fired, making them as big a menace to their firers as to their targets. But by the Renaissance the quality of metal casting had advanced enough to create smaller and far more reliable guns that could be pulled into battle by teams of horses or mounted aboard ships.King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden revolutionized the use of field artillery, employing large numbers of smaller and lighter pieces that overwhelmed slower and heavier enemy guns. He also pioneered the use of canister shot against infantry, for which foot soldiers everywhere probably cursed his name.",

As the years passed, the Janissaries gained huge political influence in the Empire, engineering frequent palace coups in the 17th and 18th centuries.

It consisted of a very long wooden arm with a sling on one end and a heavy weight on the other, mounted on a heavy wooden framework. The long arm was winched down, raising the heavy weight, and a missile was placed in the sling. When released, the weight would come down and the arm would whip up into the air, hurling the missile a huge distance.

Although slower than a standard bow, a crossbow requires less training and strength than a regular bow, and over time it came to be the dominant weapon on the battlefield. A crossbow consists of a fairly short but heavy bow mounted to a stock. The firer pulls back the string - often with mechanical assistance - to \"cock\" the bow, then lays a \"bolt\" (arrow) on a groove in the stock. The firer aims, then pulls a trigger to release the string, which launches the bolt at the target. Among other advantages, a crossbow can be fired from a kneeling or prone position, something which is impossible with a standard bow.",

As a Ranged unit it can deal significant damage to other Medieval Era units up to two hexes away, but it is vulnerable to melee attack.

In operation, the soldier would pull a lever to cock the string and then push the lever back, causing a bolt to drop out of the box and into place to be fired. This gave the Chu-Ko-Nu a faster rate of fire than a standard European crossbow. However, the Chu-Ko-Nu fired a lighter bolt and had a shorter range than a European machine. Which was the superior weapon would depend upon circumstances - the European model might prevail in open terrain against heavily armored opponents, while the Chu-Ko-Nu would probably be better at short-range against large numbers of lighter-armored attackers.",

First, their scent absolutely terrified horses, rendering the enemy's cavalry useless. Second, they could break through even the strongest line of infantry, crushing a wall of spears that no horse could ever surmount. Elephants were incredibly difficult to kill and history records them surviving sixty or more arrows. The primary problem with elephants was their tendency to go berserk with pain or rage, at which point they'd be impossible for their rider to control.

Their first recorded usage dates back to roughly the 13th century.Today, the ski infantry are still used by the Danish Navy to patrol large stretches of northern and eastern Greenland, areas of which are too rugged for most other forms of transportation. In Norway, every soldier in the army is still trained in the art of ski combat, and the Biathlon sporting event was inspired and developed from their military training and patrol routes.",

Unlike the familiar designs used by sailing ships of the period, the Turtle Ship had no upper deck. The top level of the ship was covered in iron spikes to prevent boarding, with the oarsmen and soldiers segregated onto separate decks below.

The Mayan Atlatlists would have been capable of devastating enemy lines from afar, provided they had a clear line of sight to the target.Some of the earliest atlatls date back to roughly 400,000 years ago, used by the extinct Homo heidelbergensis.

These Sea Beggars at first limited themselves to basic looting and plundering, but in a time of desperation took a Spanish town and garrison by force. Inspired by their victory, they began a more offensive campaign, capturing other cities along the coast. The success of the Sea Beggars was a rally cry to the rest of the Netherlands, and the entire nation began to revolt.

Operation of a Gatling gun involved a revolving multi-barrel design, in which a hand crank turned the mechanism. As each barrel cycled, the spent cartridge was ejected, a new one loaded, and the muzzle barrel cooled. In this manner, a high rate of fire could be maintained without overheating. What the Gatling gun lacked in accuracy was made up for by its lethality.Although not officially adopted by the United States Army until 1866, it was used for the first time in combat during the American Civil War by Union forces. It next saw use during the Peru-Chile War of the Pacific (1879-1883), which convinced European armies of its utility against massed enemies. Within a decade, the Gatling gun was adopted by most of the major powers; it was used most effectively to expand their colonial empires against the likes of the Ndebele, Zulu, Bedouins, Turkmen, Boxers, and other native peoples. In the first decade of the 1900s, designs for gas-operated \"machine\" guns made the weapon obsolete; the U.S. Army withdrew all models of the Gatling gun from service in 1911, followed soon after by the European armies.",

In addition to their traditional club and throwing spear, Shaka armed his troops with the assegai, a short-shaft stabbing spear with a broad, foot-long blade. He introduced a larger, heavier cowhide shield (isihlangu) and trained his forces to quickly close with the enemy for devastating hand-to-hand combat. Strategically, the impi relied on speed and surprise to suddenly outnumber and overwhelm their enemy. Using such methods the Zulu won impressive victories, even against rifle-armed Europeans, although their own casualties were high.",
        "strategy": "Before engaging in melee, the Impi performs a spear throw attack that can damage or kill the enemy unit before making contact. Only the Zulu may build it.",

The design was perfected by Portuguese merchants in the late 1400s; the Nau came to be a three- or four-deck ocean-going vessel with three or four masts, with a broad beam stable in the high seas of the Atlantic, and capable of carrying provisions and cargo for a lengthy trip. It had a rounded stern and a high forecastle incorporated into the bow, the first ocean-going vessel with such. Its large storage holds meant that it could traverse great distances between landfalls, making it a mainstay in the Portuguese merchant fleet. The Nau would be supplanted by the Galleon on the ocean trade routes by the 1600s.",

        "historical_info": "The original design of the galleass evolved from that of large merchant galleys, and remained relatively unchanged until 1660 AD when Venice built its first ship-of-the-line. It usually had three lateen-rigged masts, and was characterized by a forecastle as well as an aftcastle. Carrying more sails and oars than a standard galley for increased speed, these Venetian warships also had a gundeck that ran over the rowers heads. In the Mediterranean, the Venetian Galleass remained in service long after it had been replaced with larger, studier, more sea-worthy warships by other nations.",

So skilled were they that the armies of the major powers hired them as scouts and advisors, beginning as early as the Pequot War (1637-1638 AD) when the English colonists of Massachusetts Bay were aided by scouts of the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes.

Mounted on sturdy plains ponies, Comanche boys were taught to ride at a very early age. The warriors were armed with obsidian-tipped spears, devastating against opposing warriors on foot, and with bows and later rifles. The favored style of combat was guerilla warfare: short, intense, close-in mounted attacks aimed at killing as many of the enemy as possible and driving off their livestock. The so-called Comanche Wars, beginning with their first raids against Spanish outposts in New Mexico in the 1700s, raged nearly continuously until the last bands were subdued by the U.S. Army in 1875.",
