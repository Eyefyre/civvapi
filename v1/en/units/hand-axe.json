    "historical_info": "The always-reliable axe has shaped human history as both a tool and a weapon. From the sharpened piece of flint tied with vine to a wooden stick, to the modern steel blade set in a machined handle, axes have been used in every age and every region of the world. Short-handled axes, such as the tomahawk, capable of being wielded one-handed, have been used in hunting and war by many primitive peoples; long-handled, broad-bladed axes, such as the Viking Dane axe or Japanese ono, were fearsome weapons in combat. Typically used in close combat, those such as the traditional battle axe deliver more cleaving power against a smaller target area, making it more effective than a sword against armor.",
