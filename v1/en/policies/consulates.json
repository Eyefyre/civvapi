    "historical_info": "As relations between nations became more formal, consulates were established to assist and protect the interests of a country's citizens in the territory of another country, and to promote trade and friendship between the two countries. Whereas an ambassador is the singular personal representative from one ruler to another, there can be several consuls in a country, usually one in each major city.The concept of providing service to a nation's citizens while abroad arose out of the ancient Greek practice of wealthy merchants acting as a \"proxenos\" in other Hellenic city-states to aid fellow merchants. Although the role of the consulate expanded in the late 1800s to include cultural and educational exchanges, its role as a nation's representation on the local level in a distant land remains unchanged.",

        "historical_info": "Patronage is the policy where the wealthy and powerful - often the nobility - support the talented artisans in a society. In many ancient societies, a society's wealth was concentrated in a few individuals: the Royal Family, say, or the merchant princes. Painters, sculptors, musicians, and other gifted artists worked for the elite, as they were the only ones who could afford to pay them. While perhaps unfair to commoners, this system has produced brilliant works by the likes of Leonardo da Vinci, Ben Johnson, and Mozart. The system is enjoying something of a revival today, with the role of patron being taken by mega-corporations rather than individuals."
