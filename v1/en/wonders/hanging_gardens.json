They were a great source of pride to the people, and were often described in accounts written by visitors to the city. Possibly built by King Nebuchadnezzar II in 600 BC, the gardens were an ascending series of tiered platforms (not unlike a ziggurat) constructed of mud bricks and containing all manner of trees, shrubs, and vines. From a distance the gardens were said to look like a large green mountain rising from the center of the city.",
