The practice is believed to have originated in the area near the modern Iranian-Georgian border. In many cultures, wine is believed to have mystical powers and is used in countless religious ceremonies. France is the (self-proclaimed) center of wine production on the planet, but she is facing stiff competition from other countries in Europe, as well as the USA, South Africa, South America, and Australia.",
