During the early Renaissance, merchant confederations were established in city-states such as Venice and Genoa to protect the interests of traders in certain commodities while abroad. These merchant leagues reached their peak during the 15th and 16th centuries, but declined thereafter as national governments and crown-chartered companies gradually assumed the regulatory and diplomatic responsibilities the leagues had formerly held.",

These amateur soldiers usually didn't have much training and were often expected to supply their own weapons and armor, so their quality was not very high. They tended to desert when they had to tend to their crops, so battles were scheduled for the summer. If victory wasn't achieved by harvest, the war would often be called off for a year.Professional armies form when a society has grown wealthy enough to support a large number of men who do not work the fields or perform other productive work. The soldiers are usually housed in barracks and segregated from the civilian population to minimize friction, and the state provides their food, weapons, armor, and training. They are almost always more effective than the amateurs.Modern warfare has grown monumentally complex, and soldiers kill each other with extremely complicated weapons which require substantial training for effective use.

As they gained independence from the Old World most of the new nations in Central and South America were formed as republics (Mexico toyed with a monarchy for a while but this didn't survive for long).In the 20th century most of the European governments became republics after one or the other of the World Wars, as did many Asian nations.

Often composed of veterans from national armies and led by a charismatic commander such as the Englishman Sir John Hawkwood, who formed the infamous White Company, these were usually hired during times of war by city-states or small kingdoms that lacked the funds or manpower to maintain standing armies. While some of the early mercenary forces specialized in specific forms of combat - for instance, cavalry or artillery companies - most were formed of German or Swiss landsknecht and saw extensive use during the religious wars of the Reformation. Coincidentally, to the south the condottieri served in the internecine wars between the Italian city-states, including the Papacy. As late as the 1700s Scots-Gaelic Gallowglass companies were available for hire to continental nobles. In modern times, mercenaries tend to be hired in small, elite teams for specific missions, or be part of private security companies.",
