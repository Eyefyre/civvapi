    "historical_info": "In Marxist socio-political theory, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat refers to a social state where the working class has direct control of political power; \"dictatorship\" in this case does not refer to the common definition but rather that an entire social class holds control of the nation. Whether or not capitalists or others were disenfranchised in such a political order would depend, according to Marx and Engels, on specific circumstances at the time. Bringing about such a political order might, or might not, entail violence; but whatever the means, in the end the proletariat would supplant the bourgeoisie.",
