    "historical_info": "Anti-tank guns are, not surprisingly, artillery units specially designed to destroy enemy tanks. These weapons are of necessity mobile, either self-propelled or easily dragged by truck or other heavy equipment. They fire shells specially designed to penetrate enemy armor. Anti-tank guns are often quite vulnerable to enemy infantry, and thus must be supported by anti-infantry units if the enemy gets too close.",
    "strategy": "The Anti-Tank Gun is a specialized combat unit which is quite potent against enemy tanks, but weak when battling other units. Back them up with tanks of your own and artillery for a potent fighting force.",
