Arrow slits and crenellations (battlements with portions cut out at regular intervals) are required, while \"murder holes\" to shoot arrows or pour boiling oil on attackers' heads are a nice addition.Castles were the largest and most expensive sign of a country's military and economic might until the advent of gunpowder artillery made them into elaborate and expensive deathtraps for those within.",

Contrary to popular belief Henry Ford did not invent the assembly line; that was created in the 19th century in the mid-western US meat-packing industries. Beef carcasses were carried from station to station on an overhead trolley system at a steady pace; workers at each station would have a set amount of time to carve off their assigned chunk of meat before the carcass moved onto the next station. Working in a meat-packing plant was one of the dirtiest and most dangerous jobs in the history of American labor, and stories from this era can still horrify us today.",

A successful banking system requires a working currency and laws ensuring that most borrowers will repay their loans if able.Banks are remarkable engines for growth in a civilization. If a city needs something - a new granary, for instance - no individual citizen may be able to afford to construct it. However, since it contains the savings of many different citizens, the bank can afford to loan the builder the money. Once the granary is constructed the builder can use the profits to pay back the bank, and the city's citizens all benefit from the cool new granary (as well as from the interest they've earned on their deposits).Banks in Europe and the United States have gotten something of a bad rap in recent years, but this is generally because many of them dabbled in risky investment schemes or because they made loans to clearly unsuitable people.

The primary (or at least the original) purpose of stock exchanges is to allow the owners of companies to raise money by selling a portion of their company to investors. As the value of the company rises, so does the value of the stock. And of course there's risk involved as well - if the value of the stock falls, so does the value of the investment. A modern stock exchange may also sell other powerful financial \"instruments\" such as bonds, securities, options, swaps and derivatives. When properly run, a stock exchange can turbo-charge an economy. When poorly managed, it can cause financial chaos and ruin.",

The outer walls ran 10 miles in length, measured 25 ft thick, and were said to tower 320 ft over the city. Smaller walls ringed the city behind this primary one, assuring an extra line of defense if the first ever fell. Some 250 towers dotted the length of the walls, providing excellent look-out points and combat stations for the skilled Babylonian archers. The walls were impenetrable by any technology available to sieges at the time, large metal gates were installed at the river's ends, (preventing any underwater intruders), and eight massive gates were constructed to contain any foot traffic (the most famous being the Ishtar Gate). These walls effectively protected the city for almost one hundred years.It wasn't until 539 BC that a way around the wall's defenses was devised; Cyrus the Great unleashed a plan which diverted the Euphrates further upstream, lowering the water level so that anyone could walk through it. His army snuck under the river's metal gates under the cover of darkness and took the city from within. While capable of stopping any direct means of assault, the walls couldn't stop one man's determined ingenuity.Much of the ancient walls still stand, a testament to their strength. In 1983, Saddam Hussein began a reconstruction project at the site of the ancient city, including restoration of the walls and a recreation of the Ishtar Gate. The project has since been put on hold, but Iraq hopes to continue further restoration of the walls and once again make Babylon a place of wonder.",

        "historical_info": "From the Old French meaning \"company of merchants,\" the Hanse was a voluntary confederation of merchants and traders organized in a town for the protection and facility of commerce and transport. In the mercantile ports of the Baltic and North Sea these trading guilds became extremely powerful and influential in the 13th Century, with their headquarters in complexes also known as the Hanse. The largest hanse not only housed the administrative offices of the guild, but also storerooms, meeting rooms, markets, banks and, if on the waterfront, docks. The first such appears to have been built in Lubeck c. 1159 AD to facilitate trade between Western Europe and the resource-rich areas of northern Russia. The hanse would give its name to the Hanseatic League, formed around 1250 AD by several German guilds for the pacification of the Baltic trade routes, standardization of promissory notes, and commercial development of their respective cities; the League would remain a political, military (among lesser conflicts, the Dutch-Hanseatic War 1438-1441 and Hanseatic-English War 1470-1474) and economic power in the region until the late 1600s.",

In Shakespeare's London and elsewhere, playwrights banded together to protect their profits from plagiarism and unlicensed performances. Although more trade unions than guilds, today the tradition is carried on by hundreds of organizations around the world, such as the Scriptwriters Guild of Israel, Writers Guild of Great Britain, and the American Authors Guild.",

The guilds sought to fix costs and set prices, and offered support and education to artists in a city, thus avoiding the problems of patronage by the wealthy and the nobility. Although unofficial guilds still exist for various types of artists, the Enlightenment Age brought about a decline in guild monopolies until all had been abolished by the mid-1800s.",

Beginning with the rise of the modern orchestra in the 17th Century, towns and cities sponsored composers and conductors, allowing for ever more elaborate performances. This move towards \"civic music\" largely obviated the need for formal musicians' guilds. Not until the boom in popular music in the early 20th Century would musicians again formally organize, this time into unions.",

The largest could accommodate hundreds of camels, mules or horses. Most caravansaries provided basic supplies - for a fee - such as water, fodder, food, clothing and other supplies for the journey.
