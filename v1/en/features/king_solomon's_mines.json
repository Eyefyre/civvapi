    "historical_info": "King Solomon's Mines exerted a pull on European explorers in 19th Century Africa akin to that of El Dorado on Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century New World. When Europeans first encountered the mysterious ruins of the ancient city of Zimbabwe in East Africa, they were baffled by its location. Numerous explanations were put forth for its existence, but the one that captured the popular imagination was that Great Zimbabwe served to shelter and protect the workers in King Solomon's mines in the nearby Chimanimani Mountains. Here, it was believed, could be found the source of the Biblical king's legendary treasure of precious metals and gems. For several decades adventurers and fortune hunters sought the legendary mines without success.",
