    "historical_info": "Broadway is a 15-mile long street running through Manhattan and The Bronx in New York City. Although most of the thoroughfare is lined with offices, businesses and apartment complexes, it is best known for the middle section between 42nd and 53rd streets dubbed the \"Great White Way\" - the theater district. Commencing in the mid-1800s a number of theaters opened on Broadway. In 1880 AD a stretch between Madison and Union squares was illuminated with arc lamps, making it one of the first electrically lit streets in the United States. Spurred by growing American wealth and cultural aspirations, the theaters made it a mecca of popular entertainment. By 1900 some 20 theaters had opened along this stretch, and so bright were their electric billboards that it became the Great White Way. In 1925, at peak there were 80 theaters along Broadway, specializing in lavish productions, primarily revues and musicals.",
