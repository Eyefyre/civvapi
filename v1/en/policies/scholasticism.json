    "historical_info": "Scholasticism is a style of teaching employed in medieval European universities from around 1000-1500 AD. The method emphasized critical reasoning and debate. The teacher would choose a book for study, and then he and the students would debate the meaning of the book, examine other books on the same topic, examine any criticism of the work, and so forth, by so doing gaining a fuller understanding of the topic than might be gained by rote memorization. The movement was largely fueled by the rediscovery of the works of Greek philosophers and subsequent attempts to integrate them with Christianity.",

        "historical_info": "Patronage is the policy where the wealthy and powerful - often the nobility - support the talented artisans in a society. In many ancient societies, a society's wealth was concentrated in a few individuals: the Royal Family, say, or the merchant princes. Painters, sculptors, musicians, and other gifted artists worked for the elite, as they were the only ones who could afford to pay them. While perhaps unfair to commoners, this system has produced brilliant works by the likes of Leonardo da Vinci, Ben Johnson, and Mozart. The system is enjoying something of a revival today, with the role of patron being taken by mega-corporations rather than individuals."
