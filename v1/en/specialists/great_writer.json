    "strategy": "A Great Writer can create a Great Work of Writing (generates both Culture and Tourism) that is placed in the nearest city that has an appropriate building with an empty slot (like an Amphitheater, National Epic, Heroic Epic, or Royal Library). A Great Writer can also write a Political Treatise, which grants the player a large amount of Culture. Great Writers are expended when used either of these ways.",
    "historical_info": "\"Great Writers\" are those gifted men and women who express our desires, insights, fancies, foibles, fears and joys in the written word. Whether in poetry, in novels and stories, for the stage or screen, these are the artists who have defined their civilizations and cultures. Some write prose and poetry about imaginary worlds; others write tracts of philosophy, politics, religion and science about how our world is or should be. Their words echo through time, binding us all together.",
