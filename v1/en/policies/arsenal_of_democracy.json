The unofficial policy of the United States during World War II and the ensuing Cold War against Communism, the \"Arsenal\" refers to committing a nation's private industry to producing military materials for the nation and other nations with the goal of defeating a common enemy. The privately-owned manufacturers are compensated at market value, usually on a \"cash-and-carry\" basis.",
