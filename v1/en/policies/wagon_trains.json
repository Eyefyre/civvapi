    "historical_info": "In various ages, as roads became better and less prone to banditry, wagon trains replaced caravans in overland trading ventures. Able to carry more goods of more types, to provide shelter, and to travel further, wagon trains were used for commerce, war and migration. Used heavily throughout history, wagon train usage has largely faded with the arrival of the industrial age.",

        "historical_info": "Commerce deals with the exchange of goods and services, either through barter (in exchange for other goods and services) or by the exchange of some form of currency. Commerce is as old as human language and perhaps even older. In some cultures merchants occupy a lower class than those who rule or who get to carry the weapons. In other cultures, merchants are seen as the elite, and the acquisition of wealth is seen as the greatest good. For most of its recent history the United States has been the second kind of country."
