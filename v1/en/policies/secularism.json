    "historical_info": "Secularism is the belief that government should be separate from religion and religious faiths. Religions should not be taught in schools, nor should one's religion determine whether he or she can work in the government or serve in the military. Secularists don't necessarily disbelieve in a Supreme Being; they just think that mixing religion and government is ultimately bad for both institutions. The United States is largely a secular country, although traces of its early inhabitants' dominant religion can still be found on the country's money, its leaders' oaths of office, in its judicial system, and so forth, often to the dismay of the citizens who do not belong to that religion.",

        "historical_info": "Rationalism is a worldview that looks to reason (rather than, say, faith) to explain the world. Rationalism believes that reason trumps all other ways of interpreting the world, including any data gathered by one's five senses. This philosophy can be traced back to the great Socrates of ancient Greece, and it enjoyed something of a resurgence during the 16th and 17th century in Europe, when it was explored by men like Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant."
