    "historical_info": "Philanthropy is the policy where a nation's wealthiest citizens give some portion of their wealth back to the people, often in the form of libraries, museums, hospitals or scholarships. Unlike patronage, where the citizen is paying for the creation of art for himself and others of his class, philanthropy tends to benefit the poorer members of society. Scottish-American Andrew Carnegie was one of the great philanthropists in history. For much of his life Carnegie was an utterly ruthless businessman, creating the US Steel company and making the second largest fortune in history, largely on the backs of the men who slaved in his mines and foundries. Upon selling his business in 1901, Carnegie devoted the last 19 years of his life to building libraries in poor cities, providing funding to some 3,000 in the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries around the world.",

        "historical_info": "Patronage is the policy where the wealthy and powerful - often the nobility - support the talented artisans in a society. In many ancient societies, a society's wealth was concentrated in a few individuals: the Royal Family, say, or the merchant princes. Painters, sculptors, musicians, and other gifted artists worked for the elite, as they were the only ones who could afford to pay them. While perhaps unfair to commoners, this system has produced brilliant works by the likes of Leonardo da Vinci, Ben Johnson, and Mozart. The system is enjoying something of a revival today, with the role of patron being taken by mega-corporations rather than individuals."
