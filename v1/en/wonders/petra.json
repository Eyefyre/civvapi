Numerous intricately carved structures were cut into the sandstone walls of the desert canyons surrounding the area, as Petra came to serve as the capital city for the once-nomadic Nabataen people. The most famous of these structures, the Al Khazneh or \"The Treasury,\" has been featured in numerous major motion pictures, notably a prominent role in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" when the Al Khazneh was used to represent the location of the Holy Grail.",
