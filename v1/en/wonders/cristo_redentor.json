First proposed in 1921 during celebrations of the centennial of Brazilian independence, by 1931 the statue had been completed, making it the largest art deco monument in the world. Since that time, the statue, seated 2330 feet above sea level, has become a beloved symbol of Rio de Janeiro and of Brazil.",
