    "historical_info": "Composed of three volcanic cones, the highest reaching 19,340 feet - making it the highest point in Africa and the highest free-standing mountain in the world - the Kilimanjaro massif lies in northeastern Tanzania. Considered a strato-volcano, two of its peaks (Mawenzi and Shira) are extinct, while its highest (Kibo) is dormant; its last eruption dates back approximately 150 thousand years. According to Johann Krapf in 1860 the mountain was called \"Kilimanjaro\" by the Swahilis along the coast, meaning either \"mountain of greatness\" or \"mountain of caravans.\"",
