At about the same time wells were being drilled across Europe and in North America. By the early 20th century oil was in great demand, largely due to its use in internal combustion engines as used by ships, planes, and automobiles. Today much of international politics is driven by growing tension between those who have abundant sources of oil, and those who do not.

Discovered in the 18th century, it wasn't until the 20th, during the terrible crucible of World War II, that American scientists learned how to craft the mildly dangerous material into the most deadly explosive that history has ever seen. When used to power nuclear generators, uranium is seen as a \"clean\" energy, since it doesn't release the huge amounts of air pollution created by coal or petroleum. On the other hand, used nuclear fuel is incredibly toxic and poisons land, air, water, and/or any living organisms that encounter it for hundreds of years, so this is a problem too. Remember that uranium is a strategic resource, and thus it is consumed as you construct the associated units and buildings.",

First cultivated in the regions surrounding Southeast Asia, the various flowering plants of the Citrus genus have since flourished in countries throughout the world. Scurvy, a Vitamin C deficiency rampant among sailors, began to become a serious problem in the 15th century. It continued to plague ships throughout the Age of Discovery, until the introduction of lime juice and sauerkraut treatments in the 18th century. Although most sailors believed it was the acid in citrus that prevented the disease, it was actually the Vitamin C, but the end result was a healthy crew in either case.",
