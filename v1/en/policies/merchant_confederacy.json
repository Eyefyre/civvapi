    "historical_info": "More commonly referred to as a commercial league or trading guild, a Merchant Confederacy is created to protect the economic interests and diplomatic privileges of merchants in cities and nations along trade routes. Although these confederations of merchants had no official standing, several \u2013 such as the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London (founded 1407 AD) and the even more powerful Hanseatic League (formed c. 1356) \u2013 had significant economic influence and dominated specific trade routes for lengthy periods. During the early Renaissance, merchant confederations were established in city-states such as Venice and Genoa to protect the interests of traders in certain commodities while abroad. These merchant leagues reached their peak during the 15th and 16th centuries, but declined thereafter as national governments and crown-chartered companies gradually assumed the regulatory and diplomatic responsibilities the leagues had formerly held.",

        "historical_info": "Patronage is the policy where the wealthy and powerful - often the nobility - support the talented artisans in a society. In many ancient societies, a society's wealth was concentrated in a few individuals: the Royal Family, say, or the merchant princes. Painters, sculptors, musicians, and other gifted artists worked for the elite, as they were the only ones who could afford to pay them. While perhaps unfair to commoners, this system has produced brilliant works by the likes of Leonardo da Vinci, Ben Johnson, and Mozart. The system is enjoying something of a revival today, with the role of patron being taken by mega-corporations rather than individuals."
