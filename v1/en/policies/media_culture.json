Media culture, with its emphasis on advertising and public relations, has been considered by critics to be a system centered on the manipulation of the masses, notably in regard to representation and reproduction of dominant ideologies. Scholars such as Theodor Adorno and Hannah Arendt have written extensively on the impact of media culture on both democracy and capitalism.",
