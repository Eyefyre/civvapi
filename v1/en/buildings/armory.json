Unless on duty, soldiers do not usually carry their weapons with them at all times (especially if their weapons are machine guns or rocket-propelled grenades).Armories are generally heavily armored and guarded, and may resemble a full-fledged castle more than a warehouse. A military's weapons need to be protected from theft, be it minor pilferage or a rampaging mob bent upon insurrection.",
