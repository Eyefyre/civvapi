    "historical_info": "A republic is a form of government in which people or the representatives of the people have ultimate power rather than the power being vested in a monarch or despot. The people or their representatives may elect a leader, but that leader's power derives from the consent of the people. Some classical cultures have had some form of republicanism, notably several Greek city-states and Rome (for part of its history), but for most of world history the monarchy was the most common form of government.The republic reappeared on the world stage in the 18th century, when the United States divorced itself from the British monarchy and set itself up as a republic. As they gained independence from the Old World most of the new nations in Central and South America were formed as republics (Mexico toyed with a monarchy for a while but this didn't survive for long).In the 20th century most of the European governments became republics after one or the other of the World Wars, as did many Asian nations. Many parts of Africa have since followed suit as they have shed their colonial masters. Today, most nations of the world follow (or at least profess to follow) some form of republicanism.",

Serfs, slaves, and hereditary servants do not enjoy liberty, nor do citizens who are forced to live within a certain village or gulag or ghetto."
