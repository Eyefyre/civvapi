    "historical_info": "The jet fighter is extremely similar in role to its ancestor, the World War II propeller-driven fighter, but there are huge differences in the planes' power, armament, weaponry, and computer and communications equipment. The best World War II aircraft could fly at best 400 miles per hour, while a modern jet fighter can fly three times that fast. A World War II aircraft could carry one or two machine guns and possibly one or two bombs. A modern fighter can carry a 20mm Gatling gun, 10 or so air-to-air missiles, and dozens of different rockets. The vehicle is equipped with sophisticated computers, radar, and communications equipment far exceeding anything available anywhere before in history. Like other aircraft, jet fighters are vulnerable to surface-to-air missiles, but their largest threat comes from enemy fighters. Whichever side achieves air superiority will gain a nearly unbeatable advantage in combat.",
    "strategy": "The Jet Fighter is a powerful air unit. It can be based in any city you own or aboard an aircraft carrier. It can move from base to base and can perform \"missions\" within its range of \"10\". Use Jet Fighters to attack enemy aircraft and ground units, to scout enemy positions, and to defend against enemy air attacks. Jet Fighters are especially effective against enemy helicopters. The Jet Fighter has the \"air recon\" ability, which means that everything within 6 tiles of its starting location is visible at the beginning of the turn. See the rules on Aircraft for more information.",
