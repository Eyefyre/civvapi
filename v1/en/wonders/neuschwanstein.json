Built into a hillside near the town of F\u00fcssen in Germany, Ludwig had intended the castle to be his retreat from public view, as he was known for his reclusive nature. Following his death, the castle became a popular tourist attraction, and eventually served as the inspiration for the famous Sleeping Beauty Castle created by Walt Disney.",
