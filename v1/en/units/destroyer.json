    "historical_info": "A destroyer is a 20th century ship designed for patrol, escort, anti-air and anti-submarine duties. The earliest destroyers were light vessels not well-suited for oceanic cruises unless accompanied by \"tenders\" carrying additional fuel. By World War II the destroyers were fast, maneuverable and carried enough weaponry and supplies for long-range missions across the world's oceans.For weaponry, destroyers carried anti-aircraft guns, light anti-ship guns, torpedoes and depth charges. They often accompanied carrier groups, patrolling the waters around the more valuable and larger ships for submarines and providing anti-aircraft cover as well. They escorted supply convoys and patrolled harbors and coasts as well. Duty aboard a World War II destroyer was dangerous indeed; during the war over 220 British, American, Australian and Canadian destroyers were lost, mostly to aircraft attack.",
    "strategy": "The Destroyer is a naval melee attack unit designed to hunt down and destroy submarines and to provide anti-aircraft support. It often operates as an escort to embarked units, battleships and carriers when in range of enemy planes and subs. It is quick, giving it a promotion that gives it a good chance to withdraw to the rear before an enemy naval melee attack can occur.",
