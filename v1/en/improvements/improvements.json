The Acropolis in Athens, Greece, is an example of an early powerful Citadel. Such structures were almost impossible to take by direct attack, and they were capable of withstanding protracted sieges before they fell. You can construct a Citadel anywhere within your territory, or directly adjacent to your territory. Upon constructing the Citadel, your Culture borders will also expand to surround the Citadel on all sides by one hex. If the new Culture border claims hexes already owned by another civilization, you will incur a diplomatic penalty as a result. Any unit stationed within a Citadel receives a 100% defensive strength bonus. Additionally, any enemy unit which ends its turn next to a Citadel takes 30 damage (damage does not stack with other Citadels).",

The Incas in particular were masters of terrace farming, and erected large, drystone walls to hold their terraces in place. After building the terrace's shape, the Incas then constructed systems of canals and aqueducts to provide the terraces with constant water, increasing the land's fertility. The ancient Incan's terracing techniques were so successful that modern Peruvian farmers still employ them in their farms today.",

Almost half still remain at the original quarry site, but the rest were transported and erected around the island's coastline. Easily recognizable by their large heads and elongated features, it is believed that they were individual depictions of deceased ancestors and powerful chiefs.While most scholars agree on why and how the statues were created, the method of their transportation still remains a mystery. Weighing from 9 to 86 tons a piece, they would have required an amazing feat of engineering to move from quarry to final resting place.In 1994, the Moai statues were given official protection on the UNESCO World Heritage site list.",

        "game_info": "A polder is a low-lying tract enclosed by dikes with the water drained. In general, polder is land reclaimed from a lake or seabed, from flood plains, or from marshes. In time, the drained land subsides so that all polder is eventually below the surrounding water level. Because of this, water seeps into the drained area and must be pumped out or otherwise drained. The dikes are usually made of readily available materials, earth or sand; in modern times these barriers might be covered or completely composed of concrete. The drained land is extremely fertile and makes excellent pasturage or cropland.The first polders of reclaimed land were constructed in the 11th Century AD, although building embankments as barriers to water date back to the Romans. The Dutch have a long history of reclaiming marshes and fenland, and even the seabed, and possess half of the polder acreage in Europe. Although there are polders in other countries of Europe, and examples can be found in Asia and North America, Holland has some 3000 polders accounting for about 27 percent of the country's land. Amsterdam itself is built largely upon polder. As the Dutch homily states, \"God made the world, but the Dutch made Holland.\"",
