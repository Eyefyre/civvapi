These perpetual thorns in the sides of civilizations are capable of spitting out an unending stream of angry barbarians, all who seek to overrun your cities, pillage your lands and stare lewdly at your women. Encampments near to your cities should be destroyed without question. Encampments nearer to competing civilizations may be left to harass your foes, if you're that kind of sneaky leader...",
