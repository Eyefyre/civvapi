    "historical_info": "Casimir III, upon his ascension to the throne in 1333 AD, was forced to placate the restless Polish nobility by granting them extensive concessions, including the right to maintain stables the equivalent of those of the crown. Until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, these ducal stables were a source of both prestige and power, housing from fifty to several hundred horses in addition to the grooms, with rooms for tack, saddles and trappings. Some, like the ducal stable at Szczecin, were practical and functional; others were ostentatious, with pillars and statuary, as exemplified by the stable at Kraskow. Regardless of size and ornamentation, the ducal stables supplied the mounts for Poland's famed cavalry formations.",
