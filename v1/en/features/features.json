The geyser shoots a column of boiling water to a height of some 100-175 feet every 60-90 minutes (the interval determined by the ferocity of the previous eruption). Geysers occur when subterranean water hits magma (molten rock). The water is instantly turned to steam, which rushes out the nearest available opening at tremendously high pressure. Old Faithful and the other 250 geysers in Yellowstone are enjoyed by some three million visitors each year.",

        "name": "Fountain of Youth",
        "historical_info": "One of the earliest accounts of this legendary spring comes from Herodotus, who describes it as a special \"Water of Life\" giving any who drinks of it exceptionally long life. Similar stories have also been told among the indigenous people of the Caribbean and South America, which brought the Fountain of Youth to prominence during Spain's era of exploration. According to one popular story, in 1513 the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Leon heard tales of the fountain during his travels in Puerto Rico, and set sail to search for eternal life. In doing so, he discovered Florida (and become one of the first Europeans to set foot on American soil) but never did locate the mythical fountain. The Fountain of Youth continues to captivate audiences today - movies, books, comics, and games have all featured the fabled spring and man's eternal quest to obtain it.",

Once removed from the mountain, it was taken by llama and mule to the coast where it was then loaded onto treasure ships sailing back to Europe. Nearly 41,000 tons of pure silver were mined over the course of 200 years, 8,200 of which went directly to the Spanish crown. After 1800, the main silver mines were depleted, but the mining of Potosi still continues today - some for silver but now mostly for tin.",

El Dorado has captivated explorers throughout the centuries, and expeditions as late as 1804 were arranged to divine its location. However, it is now believed that the mythical city was inspired by the name of a Muisca chief, who reportedly, as part of an initiation, covered himself in a fine layer of gold dust and dove into the Guatavita Lake.",

Atolls are typically ring-shaped, encompassing a central shallow lagoon, and the islands are typically low and small. Atolls are one of the most common island types in the Pacific, the other being islands of volcanic origin. Atolls are akin to oases, in that they are often the only points of land in hundreds of square miles of pelagic expanse. Marine life and birds make ready use of atolls, and though humans have inhabited some, atolls are often hostile for larger land animals. Their low profile means that storms regularly engulf them, and there is often little shade from the powerful sun. As a result of his experiences and observations on the Beagle Voyage, Charles Darwin was the first Westerner to correctly hypothesize how atolls were formed.",

Numerous explanations were put forth for its existence, but the one that captured the popular imagination was that Great Zimbabwe served to shelter and protect the workers in King Solomon's mines in the nearby Chimanimani Mountains.
