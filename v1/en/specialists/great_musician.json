    "strategy": "A Great Musician can create a Great Work of Music (generates both Culture and Tourism) that is placed in the nearest city that has an appropriate building with an empty slot (like an Opera House or Broadcast Tower). A Great Musician can also travel to another civilization and perform a Concert Tour, which will give you a one-time boost in Tourism in that territory. Great Musicians are expended when used either of these ways.",
    "historical_info": "It has been said that \"music is the soul of a people.\" If that is indeed the case, then \"Great Musicians\" are the guardians of that soul. Whatever the form, whatever the instruments, no other art speaks to our emotions like music. From the time that men first beat out a rhythm on logs, to the modern electronic orchestra, great composers and performers have expressed the collective sorrows and joys of each civilization.",
