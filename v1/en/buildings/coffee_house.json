According to legend, the first coffee house in Vienna was opened by a Polish soldier named Jerzy Franciszek Kulcyzcki, who discovered a cache of coffee beans left behind by the retreating Ottoman-Turks following the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Vienna's caf\u00e9 culture blossomed in the 19th century, when writers and artists across the city took comfort in the laid-back atmosphere of the coffeehouses and often lingered throughout the day.",
