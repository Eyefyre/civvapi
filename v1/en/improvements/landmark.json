    "game_info": "A Landmark is any magnificent artifact, structure, work of art, or wonder of nature that draws visitors to a location. Nelson's Column in London is a landmark, as is Mount Rushmore in the United States. Not every significantly sized object, however, is a landmark: the World's Largest Ball of Twine may never rise to that stature (though it might well be worth a visit). Landmarks provide +1 Culture for each additional Era that has passed in comparison to the original Era of the Artifact.",
